# Multiclass-Skin-Cancer-Classification-using-Ensemble-Deep-Learning-XAI
Built a deep learning pipeline using the ISIC dataset with EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Swin-Tiny ensemble models. Added TTA, temperature scaling, and Grad-CAM explainability. Developed a Streamlit app for real-time predictions with robust preprocessing and PyTorch-based inference.
